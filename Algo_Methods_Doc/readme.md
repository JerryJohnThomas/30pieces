# Algo Methods

## 1. Neat Algo
* proposing a pure frontend training 
* inspiration - https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/
* faq - http://web.archive.org/web/20220125080743/https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/09/genetic-programming-mona-lisa-faq/
* similar attempts - https://medium.com/@sebastian.charmot/genetic-algorithm-for-image-recreation-4ca546454aaa
* 

* maybe we can try the GAN like approach second , 1 vs 1
* this is not NEAT as there is no neural network involved, but this is a form of GA


## what we have now

### scoring
* invert mse of very pixel in three channels

### mutation
* mutate each of the pokemons triangle with epsilon probability and with extend
