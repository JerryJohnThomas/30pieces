## How to go about backend
* If python
    * disadv: then seperate backend, that will loose us the pipeline that we have currently as backend needs server sepearaely
    * adv: we can do any shit we need
    * some conversion api and standardisation is needed
* If js frontend
    * adv: everything in the browser
    * disadv: crazy rl and other stuff from brute force is hard to do then
    
* For the neat algo i can code up everything, for RL i will need back propogation for which ill need python and not js




## day
* create triangle class and create pokemon class

## neat to do list
1. target_image storage with correct size 
1. compare image function 
    * add a size corrector on the comparer target when initiating only/ - this is not working, everything else seems to be good 
1. score function
    
1. mutate
1. populate


addons
