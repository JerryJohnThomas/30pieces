## How to go about backend
* If python
    * disadv: then seperate backend, that will loose us the pipeline that we have currently as backend needs server sepearaely
    * adv: we can do any shit we need
    * some conversion api and standardisation is needed
* If js frontend
    * adv: everything in the browser
    * disadv: crazy rl and other stuff from brute force is hard to do then
    
* For the neat algo i can code up everything, for RL i will need back propogation for which ill need python and not js
